# Autonomous Crypto Trading Agent

## Overview
The Autonomous Crypto Trading Agent is a self-improving algorithmic trading system designed for the cryptocurrency market. This project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques and real-time market data to execute trades autonomously, adapting to changing market conditions.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Collection**: Interfaces with the Binance WebSocket API to collect live market data.
- **Dynamic Trading Strategies**: Implements adaptive strategies that adjust based on market trends and signals.
- **Continuous Learning**: Employs reinforcement learning to improve trading decisions over time.
- **Risk Management**: Enforces risk constraints to protect the trading portfolio.
- **Backtesting**: Simulates trading strategies on historical data to evaluate performance before live trading.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd crypto-trading-agent
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your settings in `src/config/settings.ts` (API keys, risk thresholds, etc.).
4. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- The trading agent will start collecting market data and executing trades based on the defined strategies.
- Monitor the performance and adjust strategies as needed.

## Architecture Overview
The architecture consists of several components working together:
- **Data Collection**: Gathers real-time data from the market.
- **Strategy Execution**: Implements trading strategies to make decisions.
- **Machine Learning**: Continuously improves the trading model based on past performance.
- **Risk Management**: Ensures that trades adhere to predefined risk limits.
